- ⚡ **Things to remember:** 
	- God expects us to do what we can so that he can do want we can't
	- When practice meets oppurtunity it is called success
	- The reason the windshield in a car is big and rear view mirrors are small because what happened in your past is not as important as what will happen in your           future
	- Don't just be a thermometer that measures temprature be a thermostat that changes temprature
